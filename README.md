## Getting Started

Configure the required API keys in the `.env.local` file:


```plaintext
# Required for OCR functionality
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here

# Required for ChatPDF functionality
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# Maybe Required for Serverless deployment for Image Rendering during ChatPDF chatting session
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN="your_blob_read_write_token"
```

You need to obtain:

- A Mistral API key for the OCR functionality to process PDF documents
- An Anthropic API key for the ChatPDF feature to enable AI-powered document chat
- For image rendering, deployment to a host may be necessary. If the deployed host operates in a serverless environment without a filesystem, a separate blob storage service should be used. This project is designed to run locally without requiring a blob service.

Without these API keys, the respective features will not work properly.

Run the development server:

```bash

pnpm dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
